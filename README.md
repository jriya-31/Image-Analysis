# 📄 OCR-Based Document Image Analysis System  

## 🚀 Overview  
The **OCR-Based Document Image Analysis System** automates text extraction from images using **Tesseract OCR** and **OpenCV**. This system efficiently converts scanned documents into editable text, reducing manual efforts and improving accuracy. Extracted text is processed with **Regex and NLP techniques**, stored in **Cassandra**, and presented via a **user-friendly web interface**.

---

## 📌 Features  
✅ **Automated OCR Processing** – Converts images into editable text.  
✅ **Image Preprocessing** – Uses OpenCV for better text clarity (Grayscale, Thresholding, Noise Reduction).  
✅ **Text Cleaning & Validation** – Post-processing with Regex & NLP.  
✅ **User Review & Editing** – Allows users to edit, copy, and export extracted text.  
✅ **Scalable Storage** – Stores extracted text in Cassandra for fast retrieval.  
✅ **Error Handling** – Manages unreadable text, duplicate data, and database failures.  
✅ **Intuitive Web Interface** – Simple UI for uploading and managing documents. 

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
| Component    | Technology Used |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Frontend** | React.js (or HTML/CSS) |
| **Backend**  | Django / Flask |
| **OCR Engine** | Tesseract OCR, OpenCV |
| **Database** | Cassandra (NoSQL) |
| **Deployment** | Docker / AWS / Firebase (optional) |

## 🖥️ System Architecture  
📌 **Image Reference:** [`assets/system_architecture.png`](./assets/system_architecture.png)  

The architecture consists of a **React frontend** for user interaction, a **Flask/Django API** for OCR processing, and **Cassandra** for scalable data storage. The OCR engine (Tesseract + OpenCV) extracts text from images, which is then processed, validated, and stored.

## 🔄 System Flow  
📌 **Image Reference:** [`assets/system_flow.png`](./assets/system_flow.png)  

The **OCR processing flow** follows these steps:  
1️⃣ **User Uploads an Image** → JPEG, PNG, or PDF.  
2️⃣ **Image Preprocessing (OpenCV)** → Noise reduction, grayscale conversion, thresholding.  
3️⃣ **OCR Extraction (Tesseract)** → Extracts raw text from the processed image.  
4️⃣ **Text Post-Processing (Regex, NLP)** → Cleans and formats the extracted text.  
5️⃣ **Validation & Error Handling** → Checks for readability, duplicates, and inconsistencies.  
6️⃣ **Storage (Cassandra)** → Saves the final text for retrieval.  
7️⃣ **User Review & Export** → Allows users to edit, copy, or download text.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jriya-31/Image-Analysis.git
cd OCR-Document-Analysis

###2️⃣ Backend Setup  
```bash

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

###3️⃣ Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

###4️⃣ Database Setup (Cassandra)
Start Cassandra Database

```bash
cassandra -f
Create the necessary tables (inside CQL shell):

sql
CREATE KEYSPACE ocr WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '1'};
USE ocr;
CREATE TABLE documents (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, text TEXT, timestamp TIMESTAMP);
📌 Usage
1️⃣ Upload an Image
Open the web app and select a document image.

2️⃣ OCR Processing
The backend processes the image, extracts text, and displays it in an editable format.

3️⃣ Edit & Save
Users can make corrections and save/export the text in JSON/CSV format.

🚀 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
📌 Image Reference: assets/kpi_chart.png

✔️ OCR Accuracy – Measures correct text extraction percentage.
✔️ Processing Speed – Average time taken per document.
✔️ Error Rate – Percentage of failed OCR attempts.
✔️ User Engagement – Frequency of text edits & corrections.

⚠️ Exception Handling
📌 Image Reference: assets/error_handling.png

✅ Unreadable Text: If OCR fails, prompts the user to upload a clearer image.
✅ Duplicate Data: Prevents redundant storage of the same extracted text.
✅ Database Errors: Logs failures and retries the operation.

📌 Future Enhancements
🚀 Multilingual OCR Support – Process documents in multiple languages.
🚀 Handwriting Recognition – AI-based handwritten text detection.
🚀 Cloud Integration – Save extracted text to Google Drive / AWS S3.
🚀 AI-Based Text Correction – Improve extracted text accuracy using deep learning.
